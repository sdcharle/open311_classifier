Because of this, the snow has melted and refrozen into an invisible sheet of ice over the red brick sidewalk.  This morning as I left my home, I slipped and fell very hard on the sidewalk and bruised my hip.  I'm now dealing with pain in my back and hips.  My emergency maintenance man has basically blown me off even after stating that I had fallen and gotten hurt, so I am reporting Jeanne Walters Real Estate.\n",

       "9364   Is the street sign at the corner of W.17th and formerly Rogers/Kinser Pike correct?  It is now labeled as Madison St..  I've lived on W. 17th since 1977.  The street going South off of W. 17th at this intersection has always been Rogers St.  The street going North at this intersection with W. 17th was always Kinser Pike.  Was there a change so that this street(s) has now 3 different names in <1 block?                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "83173  I called a year ago for a recycling bin for my residence at 3607 E. Morningside Dr. After confirming that I own the property and that I do not have any recycling bins, I was told that the bin would be dropped off on my next recycling pick up. It was not. I called again and was told that you were very sorry and it would be there the next week. As most of my neighbors have 2 or 3 recycling bins, I can only assume the address was written down incorrectly. Therefore, I am emailing this request to make sure that the bin comes correctly to 3607 E. Morningside Dr. Thank you, Liz   \n",
